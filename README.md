# Crater baiter
Helps the average mage keep track of helpful portals, successfully showing people the magic of the Dalaran Crater

In order to do this we want to ideally:
- Have an in-game Addon that can log a users "helped" players, possibly get insights but most likely upload to the central repo
- Similar to recount, or uploading logs, we possibly want a web-based app for tracking and doing statistics.

## World of Warcraft Addon
Addons are written in lua, which i know very little about.. i have the game installed on my macOS,

### Development mode
Best way i can think of to do iterative development is to create a symlink to the add-on repo folder into my wow addons folder

## App
*update 2025: work in progress restoring the backend/api app part*
auth is handled using discord oauth
